Jellyfish is currently in heavy development
and is not yet useful for much.

Jellyfish is a game engine designed around multiplayer.
We handle networking, sending packets, and updating state,
so you can focus on what you care about —
designing your game.

## Features

- Write your code once,
run the same bundle on the server and the client,
and we take care of the rest.
State is automatically synchronized between clients.

- Supports WebGL rendering
(thanks to [PIXI.js](https://www.pixijs.com/))
and optionally, physics
(thanks to [matter.js](https://brm.io/matter-js/)).

- Supports JavaScript and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

- No IDE. You already like your editor,
and we could never compete with it.
Use what you're comfortable with.

- Easy to learn, but powerful.
Jellyfish isn't magic
— it does things automatically when you want,
but let's you control the details when you need.
